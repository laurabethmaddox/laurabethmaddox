### Laura Beth Maddox

I became interested in working in the tech field after a family member told me about Nashville Software School. At the time I was working at a title company and knew I needed a change. I then started to do a few classes on Team Tree House and decided I would really enjoy a career in the field. I am someone who loves to solve problems and think algorithmically. My time at NSS has allowed me futher my knowledge on those topics and my love for technology to grow.

I am currently looking for a position as an Entry-Level Software Developer. If you have any openings, please reach out. <br/>
